# timsort
Implementing Timsort in C++ and comparing vs other sorting methods

We will aim to compare Timsort with:
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Count Sort
- Radix Sort 
- Bubble Sort
- Quicksort
- Heapsort


## Project Layout 
The main function will take an input array of numbers, and ask the user which method(s)
they'd like to use to sort the array. It will then return the sorted array, along with the time taken for the sort to complete.

I will provide some default arrays to be sorted for experimentation/exploration, as well as giving the user the ability to sort on their own
